## Advent of Code 2015 Java 17

following rules:
* every file is runnable on its own (so if you are not familiar with compiling than executin java, you can stand next to the file and execute like: `java NotQuiteLisp.java`)
* if you plan to use the gradle build script the resulting applicaition reads data from the resources (replace it in your jar / prebuild to your input, if you want to see your numbers)
* if you run the bare classes (first point), then replace the `INPUT` String to your input. (Keep in mind: indentation is key here)

this was fun
